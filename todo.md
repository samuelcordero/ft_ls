[x] implement flags
[x] check time sort
[ ] check broken links and link target name display -> changed stat to lstat, broken links shouldnt crash
[x] check total blocks
[ ] check column formatting for -l
[ ] try to optimize
[ ] check sorts -> added first dot skipping for ascii sorting, but looks like links are sorted by target instead of linkname?
